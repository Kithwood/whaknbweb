## About Tang Soo Do Mi Guk Kwan

The martial art known as Tang Soo Do is relatively modem. However, its basis, the 
Korean disciplines of Soo Bahk, and Tae Kyun, dates back many centuries. Tang Soo 
Do is a composites style influenced by the Northern Chinese arts, the Southern 
Chinese arts, and the Okinawan discipline of Karate. The Chinese influences were 
as follows; Basic Training (Seh Bop - method of postures, Bo Bop - method of steps, 
Ryun Bop - method of conditioning), and form and combat applications, (Dham Toi 
Sip E Ro, and "Tae Kuk Kwon"). The Okinawan influences were primarily a result of 
the Japanese occupation of Korea from 1910-1945. The term "Tang Soo Do" was the 
name Grandmaster Won Kuk Lee, founder of Chung Do Kwan originally applied to 
his art. After a meeting with Mr. Lee in 1947, Kwan Jhang Nim Hwang Kee decided to 
integrate the art of "Tang Soo Do" (Okinawan discipline of Karate) into his Hwa Soo 
Do discipline. Our kicking techniques, for which Tang Soo Do is recognized are 
based on the ancient Korean kicking style of Tae Kyun which were later formalized by 
Grandmaster Hwang Kee, founder of the Hwa Soo Do Moo Duk Kwan style. Tang Soo 
Do is both a hard and soft style, deriving its hardness in part from Soo Bahk and its 
soft flowing movements from the Northern and Southern Chinese systems.

Grandmaster Charles Ferraro, founder of the Mi Guk Kwan system, began his 
studies in Tang Soo Do Moo Duk Kwan in 1967 under Mr. Robert Cheezic, pin #2278. 
After the formation of the U. S. Tang Soo Do Moo Duk Kwan Federation in 1976. Kwan 
Jhang Nim Ferraro became a student of Master Hyun Chul Hwang, son of 
Grandmaster Hwang Kee. From 1976-1996 Kwan Jhang Nim Ferraro studied and 
obtained a high level of proficiency in many martial and natural health disciplines, 
(8th Dan - Recognized as Founder (Kwan Jhang Nim) of Tang Soo Do Mi Guk Kwan, 
6th Dan Ju-jutsu, 5th Dan Tang Soo Do Moo Duk Kwan, 5th Dan Aiki-jutsu, 3rd Dan 
American Goju, Certified Instructor Kali, and Master of Reiki - the art of natural 
healing).

Kwan Jhang Nim Charles Ferraro opened his first Dojang in 1976 in New Haven, CT, 
under the name of New England Tang Soo Do Academy. After moving his Dojang to 
West Haven, CT in 1978, Kwan Jhang Nim Ferraro decided to change the name of 
his school to West Haven Academy of Karate, Achievement Centers. At the time of 
this writing Grandmaster Ferraro and his students have opened eighteen Dojangs in 
four states.

Because of the aforementioned achievements, growth and development of the 
various Dojangs, and the philosophical and fiscal direction of the existing 
federations, Grandmaster Charles Ferraro founded and established the Tang Soo 
Do Mi Guk Kwan, ("A brotherhood, school, and place in America to practice the way of 
the empty hand defense").

On December 9th, 1995, fifty-nine of Kwan Jhang Nim Ferraro's senior students and 
studio owners held an unprecedented and historic meeting. It was at this meeting 
that it was decided by unanimous vote to form a new martial arts organization. It was 
through the dedicated efforts of those in attendance at this inaugural meeting that the 
Tang Soo Do Mi Guk Kwan Association, Inc. was formed with Kwan Jhang Nim 
Charles Ferraro as its president.

Although Tang Soo Do and its great combat applications can be adapted to 
competition, it is not a sport. As a classical martial art, its purpose is to develop every 
aspect of the "self" in order to create a mature person who totally integrates his/her 
intellect, body, emotions, and spirit. This integration helps to create a person who is 
free from inner conflict and who can deal with the outside world in a mature, 
intelligent, forthright, and virtuous manner. The Mi Guk Kwan name gives us a 
direction where we can blend the philosophies of the East and the West, a vehicle 
through which we can focus our mental training and foster the American way of life. 
Tang Soo Do is the technique, Mi Guk Kwan is the philosophy. Tang Soo Do 
technique requires the mental discipline that Mi Guk Kwan offers. The two combined 
produce the total integration of mental, spiritual, and physical development which 
increases the benefits of each. From their harmony an awareness of being is created 
that makes Tang Soo Do Mi Guk Kwan training a valuable art form.

As a result of the decision to form the Tang Soo Do Mi Guk Kwan Association, Inc., an 
elected and appointed Board of Directors was established to guide it's membership 
in the growth and continuation of Tang Soo Do in the United States. The Board also 
maintains the standards of excellence set by Grandmaster Charles Ferraro and his 
appointed Technical Advisory Committee. The chartered members of the TAC are Sa 
Bom Nim Richard Kopf, Sa Bom Nim Howard Dugan, and Sa Bom Nim Joseph 
DeVita.

Due to the vision, courage, and action of Kwan Jhang Nim Ferraro and many mature, 
intelligent, and independent individuals including the Char-ter Members, Technical 
Advisory Committee and Board of Directors who worked to create the Association, the 
future success of the Tang Soo Do Mi Guk Kwan is a virtual certainty.

Tang Soo Do practitioners are positive thinkers with a "rock-hard determination" to 
succeed. We are proud of our achievements, yet we know there is much more to 
learn. We are winners who share an unbreakable solidarity, yet we have 
independence to speak what we feel. These qualities will forever hold us together as 
kinsmen, as a family, and assure future generations that they will inherit the way of 
Tang Soo Do Mi Guk Kwan.
